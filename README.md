Challenge for a opportunity for a Senior developer at Eldorado Institute (Manaus-AM).
The goal is to develop a website to manage devices (create, list and delete). Each device has a category and the categories can also be managed (create, list en delete).
The programming language to be used is Angular 8 (frontend) and Node.JS (backend API). The database must be MySQL.
It's a plus if the project is deployed on a AWS server and if automated tests are developed.
